Installing Cartopy currently requires you to build it from source. The 
latest release is available from https://github.com/SciTools/Cartopy.

Once you have satisfied the requirements detailed below, 
extract the Cartopy source package, cd to the new directory, and enter::

  python setup.py install


In-place build - an alternative for developers
==============================================
We strongly encourage people to contribute to Cartopy and for this type of 
development activity an in-place build can be useful. Once you've cloned 
the Cartopy git repository you can perform an in-place build by entering::

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Build requirements
==================
These are external packages which you will need to install before
installing Cartopy. 

Many of these packages are available in Linux package managers
such as aptitude and yum. For example, it may be possible to install 
Numpy using::

  apt-get install python-numpy

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux, 
you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev" 
postfix) in addition to the core packages.  

python 2.7 or later (http://www.python.org/)
    Cartopy requires Python 2.7 or later, but is not currently compatible with Python 3.

numpy 1.6 or later (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
    Python package for scientific computing including a powerful N-dimensional array object.

Cython 0.15.1 or later (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cython/)
